```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


##Reading the data into R using the API

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
data <- read_csv(file ="./data/story-sales.zip" )
View(data)

unique(data$City)

```

##Cleaning the data in R

```{r}
library(lubridate)
data$new_date<- as.Date(data$Date, "%m/%d/%Y")
data$month<-month(data$new_date)
data$day<-day(data$new_date)
data$year<-year(data$new_date)
```

##The objective: shiny app should have at least two tabs:

#one tab that summarizes a temporal (time -i.e. day; week; month) aspect in the data

```{r}

```
#one tab that summarizes a spatial aspect in the data

```{r}

```

#Note: Each tab should show a visualization (you could look into plotly for an interactive visualization) and have at least two widgets to change an aspect of what you show.
