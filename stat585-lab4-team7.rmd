Read the file

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(jsonlite)
data<- read_csv(file ="./data/story-sales.zip" )
```


##Reading the data into R using the API

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
URL=("https://data.iowa.gov/resource/m3tr-qhgy.json")
d_ta<-jsonlite::fromJSON (URL)%>%filter(Country==Story) 

```

##Cleaning the data in R

```{r}

```

##The objective: shiny app should have at least two tabs:

#one tab that summarizes a temporal (time -i.e. day; week; month) aspect in the data

```{r}

```
#one tab that summarizes a spatial aspect in the data

```{r}

```

#Note: Each tab should show a visualization (you could look into plotly for an interactive visualization) and have at least two widgets to change an aspect of what you show.
